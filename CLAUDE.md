# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project: Housing Need

This repository is currently being initialized. Once code is added, this file should be updated with:

1. **Build and Development Commands**: How to build, test, lint, and run the project
2. **Architecture Overview**: High-level structure and key architectural decisions
3. **Project-Specific Conventions**: Any coding standards or patterns specific to this codebase

## Current Status

This is a fresh repository. As the codebase develops, update this file to help future instances of Claude Code work more effectively.
